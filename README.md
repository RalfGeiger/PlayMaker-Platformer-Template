## Problems  
It turns out that there are problems with the archive provided. Some FSMs are swallowed up. It could be related to the upgrade to PlayMaker version 1.9.5f3.  Therefore I offer the complete project for download until I have solved the problem. Only Playmaker should be installed into the project. Please excuse the procedure.

## General info
This project was born from an idea to create a 2D Jump n Run template, which offers the same features as the Corgi Engine.  

The project was realized with Unity and Playmaker. Please note that Playmaker is a Visual Scripting and is not free, but it is worth to buy it. 

The following features are released:
* Update the Project to Unity 2021
* Using new Input-System
* Using URP-Render-Pipeline

* Paralax Scrolling
* Control of the player
* Player Crouch
* Player climbing ladders
* Player jumping, double jumping, multi jumping
* Player jumps on the heads of enemies to kill them (Mario style)
* 3 different enemies with AI
* 2 collectibles
* Movable, rotate, breakable and invisible platforms
* Switches and doors
* Bouncing pads
* Stompers
* Checkpoints
* Swinging blades
* Showing screen
* ExtraLife

More features are planned (a Turrican clone ...)

	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Unity 2021.3.0f1 
* Playmaker 1.9.4.f2
* Some other Assets (See the attached description for more information, in work)
	
## Setup
A new Unity project from version 2021+ with URP is required. Also Playmaker version 1.9.4+ is required to run. More info about layers, variables, tags etc. in the enclosed installation guide (in work).

## The project status
The template is under development. Many features are in planning. Idea is to extend the project to create a Turrican clone.
